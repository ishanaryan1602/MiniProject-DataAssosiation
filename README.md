# MiniProject-DataAssosiation

this is a mini project where user that are loggen in can create posts , like them and edit as well 
I have used 
jwt 
bcrypt 
cookies 
tailwind 
ejs 
ans some standard packages 

The errr page is handled using a custom midlleware catch all block but can be also handled by this simple middleware -> app.use((req,res,next)=>res.render("error_page_name"));
